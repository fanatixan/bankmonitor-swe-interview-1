# Backlog

## Task

The client stores its Java microservices participating in the microservice architecture in polyrepo mode.
Currently, they are undergoing a modernization process throughout our entire codebase, and they would like all their microservices to:

- Contain maintainable, readable Java 17 code,
- Idiomatically use Spring Boot,
- Follow RESTful API best practices,
- Be adequately tested with proper coverage.

**The task is to refactor this simple microservice found in this repository according to the above criteria.**

To complement the situation, assume that this is an application already running in production,
under continuous load (400-500 QPS), so new code can only be deployed without downtime.

Do the refactor in a way that achieves the desired result, but if the CI/CD pipeline automatically
deploys your changes (build+test+deploy), it should not affect the business logic, functionality of the microservice,
cause data loss, etc. The refactor must be isolated, meaning that it should not change the clients using the service;
the new code should work with existing clients.
